## Code for the research paper: "Single Camera Spatial Face Localization for Immersive Gaming and Visualization Applications"

The paper is currently being reviewed at Springer's journal of Computer Vision. The prototype source code (in Python) and data for the accuracy measurements are provided here.

I am working on a more optimized production-ready CAD visualizer in C++, and it will be uploaded to a separate repository when complete.
